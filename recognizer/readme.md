## Project Description
In this project, you will build a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). You will be provided a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video. Your goal would be to train a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of this dataset to try and identify individual words from test sequences.

As an optional challenge, you can incorporate Statistical Language Models (SLMs) that capture the conditional probability of particular sequences of words occurring. This will help you improve the recognition accuracy of your system.
