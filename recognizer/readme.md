## Project Description
In this project, I built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL).A preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video was provided. My goal was to train a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of this dataset to try and identify individual words from test sequences.
