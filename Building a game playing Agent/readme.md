## Build a Game-Playing Agent
For the AIND Project 2: Build a Game-Playing Agent, we were introduced to the game Isolation and the concepts of Minimax tree search and Alpha-Beta pruning.

In addition we were asked to develop our own heuristics to attempt to beat the supplied heuristics. This was more difficult than expected and illustrated the tradeoff between a heuristic complexity and speed when used for tree search.

## Instructions
Play against AI:

```bash
$ python play.py
```

Run tests:

```bash
$ pytest 
```
